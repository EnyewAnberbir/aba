                            and productiveness of plants. Fertilizers enhance the natural fertility of the soil or replace
                            chemical elements taken from the soil by previous crops.They are additional substances supplied
                            to the crops to increase their productivity. These are used by the farmers daily to increase the
                            crop yield. These fertilisers contain essential nutrients required by the plants, including nitrogen,
                            potassium, and phosphorus. They also enhance the water retention capacity of the soil and increase
                            its fertility.</p>

                            Focused on the production of inorganic fertilizer but it also produce organic ferilizers.Organic fertilizers 
                            are Natural ferilizers they just obtained from  plant and animals. They enrich the soil with carbon compounds.
                            In organic Fertilizers are chemical fertilizer helps the plant by giving variety of neutrients.Our company have 
                            a plan to combine organic and inorganic ferilizer to get best product.</p>

                        <p>A fruit is a mature, ripened ovary, along with the contents of the ovary. The ovary is the ovule-bearing
                            reproductive structure in the plant flower. a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants 
                            that is formed from the ovary after flowering.The outer layer, often edible, of most fruits is called 
                            the pericarp. Typically formed from the ovary, it surrounds the seeds; in some species, however, other
                            structural tissues contribute to or form the edible portion.One of the main functions of a fruit is 
                            to spread the seeds and allow the plant to reproduce. Therefore, all flowering plants produce fruit, 
                            regardless of whether the fruit is edible, sweet, or soft.</p>

                            A diet rich in vegetables and fruits can lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke,
